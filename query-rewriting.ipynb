    "# Query Rewriting\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAG we can often encounter issues with the users query. This could be inaccuracy, ambiguity, or even a lack of information. In general its pretty common that the query is not optimal for the retrieval phase of RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the following scenario. You're building an application that automatically answers support tickets. Queries in this case will be emails from customers. You can imagine the following issues that can arise:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Emails often contain noise, such as greetings, signatures, etc. which are not relevant for the question and can confuse the model.\n",
    "- The user might have multiple questions in the same email, which makes it harder to retrieve the correct documents. \n",
    "- The question posed by the user might be ambiguous, or not specific enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "A group of techniques in the **Pre-retrieval** phase categorised as **Query Rewriting** are trying to remedy issues like these. This notebook will explore these methods of rewriting queries to make them more suitable for the retrieval phase of RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following exmaples will be covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rewrite-Retrieve-Read**: Explore a technique proposed in the paper [Query Rewriting for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14283.pdf)\n",
    "- **Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)**: Generate hypothetical documents to align the semantic space proposed in the paper [Precise Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval without Relevance Labels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10496.pdf)\n",
